# RAG PDF Question Answering App

This project is a **streamlit-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** app that allows users to upload a PDF, ask questions about its content, and receive AI-generated answers with cited evidence.

 **Live Demo**: [Try it here](https://rag-app-stremlit-khaledyaish.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- Upload any PDF document.
- Ask natural language questions about its content.
- Uses FAISS + Sentence Transformers for fast document search.
- Evidence snippets with page numbers.
- BART summarizer for accurate, concise answers.

## Requirements

Install dependencies locally with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or deploy directly to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

## How It Works

1. Upload a PDF.
2. PDF gets split into chunks and vectorized using SentenceTransformer.
3. FAISS finds the top matching chunks.
4. Cross-Encoder re-ranks them for better relevance.
5. Top 3 chunks are passed to `facebook/bart-large-cnn` summarizer to produce the final answer.
6. Evidence chunks are displayed alongside the answer.
