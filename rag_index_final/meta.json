Artificial Intelligence (AI) has occupied scientists for decades. But in 2023, it caught the attention of global businesses, policymakers and civil society alike. In the UK, King Charles III called it “one of the greatest technological leaps in the history of human endeavour” . The UN Secretary General described AI as “unprecedented” and even the Pope stated that AI “has the potential to contribute in a positive way to the future of humanity” before dedicating World Peace Day 2023 to the use of AI. As business leaders in Travel & Tourism it is vital that we understand the opportunities and challenges of this transformative technology. I am therefore delighted that the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) has partnered with Microsoft, one of our members and a leading technology company, to bring you the very latest insights into AI and what it could mean for our sector. What follows is the first report in a four-part initial series on artificial intelligence. We begin with an introduction to AI: how it works, where it came from and the different types of AI available today. Three further publications will explore how AI is currently being used in Travel & Tourism, and the fast- moving world of AI governance, safety and regulation. By understanding these trends, we aim to help Travel & Tourism business leaders to prepare for the future and navigate the complexities of AI. But this report isn’t just technical facts and figures.

Small advancements accumulate and then all of a sudden, the world is a different place. That could describe the world before and after the birth of the internet and could now be applied to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has ‘gradually, then suddenly’ burst onto the scene after nearly a century of research. It is almost impossible to browse the news or social media today, without seeing mention of Artificial Intelligence and the magazines Time, Science, Cosmopolitan and The Economist (to name only a few) have all dedicated cover stories to AI in 2023. But where has AI come from and why is it suddenly such big news? This report aims to answer those questions, by providing a general introduction to Artificial Intelligence technology, its business applications and its relevance to Travel & Tourism. BRIEF HISTORY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AI has gained significant attention in recent years – and especially in 2023 – but AI is not new and can trace its history back to the development of computers after the Second World War, with the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 bringing together researchers from multiple fields to explore “thinking machines” . This is widely considered the start of AI as a distinct field of study and where the term “Artificial Intelligence” was used for the first time by the visionaries at that conference. But it was not until the turn of the century that AI really came to the public’s attention, when the IBM Deep Blue supercomputer beat chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997, with artificial intelligence algorithms developed by",

These events showed the world for the very first time that computers powered with large amounts of data and artificial intelligence software – albeit very powerful computers out of reach of the general public - were capable of outperforming humans at very complex tasks. Over the past decade several companies have taken this a step further and developed AI systems that have achieved incredible results and performed tasks not possible by humans, due to the huge scale and complexity of the challenge. AlphaFold from Google Deepmind is one example. The programme uses AI to predict the 3D structure of nearly every protein in the human body. This improves our understanding of diseases like Alzheimer’s and can massively accelerate research into medicines, vaccines and drugs. Healthcare is therefore one of the most important and useful applications of AI. In 2018 a painting called “Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy” was sold at Christie’s auction house in New York for a staggering $432,500 (USD). It was generated with artificial intelligence after being trained on many images of portraits from the 18th and 19th centuries and was the first piece of AI art sold at auction. The sale sparked a significant debate about the future role of humans in creative professions, such as art and digital media.

In 2023, a museum in The Hague (Netherlands) loaned the world famous, Girl with Pearl Earring (c. 1665) by Johannes Vermeer to an international exhibition and temporarily replaced it in their gallery with an AI inspired version entitled Girl with Glowing Earrings, with many visitors to the gallery believing it was a real painting. In April 2023 the German artist Boris Eldagsen won the 2023 Sony World Photography Award with an image entitled Pseudomnesia: The Electrician, before refusing the prize after revealing it was created by AI. (Pseudomnesia is Latin for fake memory!) These images show how far AI creative technology has advanced in only a few short years, from an ability to generate low quality AI portraits in 2018, to high quality AI paintings and photorealistic AI images today. Both the Girl with Pearl Earring and Pseudomnesia images were created with AI software that is now available to everyone online and is partly why AI has taken off with the public in 2023, enabling any of us to become potential artists. But paintings and photography are not the only form of art that has been shaped by AI. In 2023 the Grammys announced that music created with AI would be eligible for awards and Paul McCartney announced he had used AI to extract John Lennon’s voice from an old demo tape. In late 2023, this track was released as the final Beatles Song Now and Then 1 which drew considerable public attention to AI across all generations. Canadian singer Grimes has also invited anyone to create new songs with an AI copy of her voice, offering to split the royalties equally on any AI track that is commercially successful.",

Imagine being able to produce a corporate marketing video easily and in only a few moments on your office laptop, or even turning your favourite book into a movie using AI. Whilst AI generated video does not currently exist at this advanced level yet, it is clear that AI is rapidly moving forward and has huge potential for both businesses and society. But there are also risks and concerns about the widescale adoption of AI, which are covered later in this report. The use of AI has led to some highly publicised events, such as a strike by Hollywood actors and writers in 2023, partly due to concerns about AI’s impact on the movie industry. Their concerns include the ability of AI to write scripts and the potential to create an AI digital replica of an actor (or extra), which could be included in films, without the physical actor present and potentially long after they have died. The full impact of AI on jobs of the future is yet to be determined, but it is possible that labour strikes will be experienced in other industries as AI rolls out further into society and other areas of work. There is also a concern that AI could be used for disinformation (the deliberate sharing of false information), especially to interfere with political elections. High quality, photorealistic – but fake – images have already gone viral on the internet, such as an AI generated image of the Pope wearing a puffer jacket and an image purporting to show the arrest of former US President Donald Trump.

It is therefore clear that the wide scale implementation of AI across society needs ‘guardrails’ for its appropriate use, which could range from formal regulations to codes of conduct and best practice guidance. These options are discussed further in an accompanying WTTC report on ‘AI Risks & Governance’.

For AI this happened with the international release of a sophisticated AI powered chatbot, named ChatGPT, in November 2022 from a company called OpenAI. This caught the public’s attention, registering over 100 million users in only 2 months and making it (at the time) the fastest growing consumer product of all time. This tipped AI into the public mainstream in 2023 and sparked the current worldwide interest in AI. While ChatGPT was the first AI chatbot to reach mass consumption, others are now available including Google Bard, IBM Watsonx.ai and Microsoft Copilot, with others produced around the world, such the Ernie AI chatbot from Baidu in China. These sophisticated AI chatbots are not the only way to use AI, but they have exposed the power of AI to the general public, which everyone can now access on their desktop computers and smartphones (and through digital connections to the ‘cloud’), unlike the 1990’s when the use of AI was limited to a very small number of owners of supercomputers (such as IBM Deep Blue).

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & WHY THERE IS GLOBAL INTEREST NOW One of the most important aspects of AI is that it is a multi-use technology. Like electricity it can be applied in lots of different ways, to lots of different scenarios. There is no single, universally accepted definition for Artificial Intelligence, but the Oxford English Dictionary defines AI as “the capacity of computers, or other machines, to exhibit intelligent behaviour”. This means AI systems appear to think, learn and act like humans and in some cases exceed the capabilities of humans. AI systems can analyse vast amounts of data, solve complex problems, make decisions and perform creative tasks.FAKE FAKE",

It is these three components of advanced algorithms, data and computing power , that explain how machines can exhibit intelligent behaviour and why AI has suddenly exploded into our everyday lives. Algorithms tell computers what to do. Data tells computers what to learn. Computing power gives machines the power to learn and make decisions ALGORITHMS : THE BRAINS OF AI ‘Traditional programming’ involves encoding human knowledge and experience into a set of precise rules that a computer can follow, step-by-step, which make the computer appear to respond intelligently. These rules, called algorithms, tell computers how to perform tasks and in traditional programming are often expressed in an ‘IF-THEN-ELSE’ format, which resembles a decision tree. For example to create a ‘digital doctor’, an algorithm might look like: IF the patient has a fever THEN prescribe Drug X ELSE send the patient home The intelligence in traditional computer systems comes directly from human knowledge and expertise being recorded into a format that a computer can process. Humans can read this ‘computer code’ and understand how these digital systems make specific decisions and can therefore identify mistakes and improve the system. For example, in the ‘digital doctor’ scenario, new clauses could be added to deal with special cases, or to reflect new medical knowledge. For example: IF the patient has a fever AND is allergic to Drug X THEN prescribe Drug Y ELSE prescribe Drug X",

To develop a useful and reliable ‘digital doctor’, a huge number of rules and exceptions would be required that the system would very quickly become very large and very complicated. Thousands of IF-THEN-ELSE rules would still be unlikely to capture all of a real doctor’s expertise and experience gained over time. Therefore traditional programming of ‘intelligent systems’ is best suited to constrained environments which do not change much over time and where the rules can be strictly defined. A good example of this could be an intelligent ‘tax calculator’ which when presented with an individual’s financial income and other relevant circumstances could efficiently review a series of ‘IF-THEN-ELSE’ rules to calculate their tax liability. Traditional Programming Artificial Intelligence (AI) Unlike traditional programming, AI systems are not explicitly coded in a series of precise steps, but instead ‘learn’ how to solve a problem by examining training data. In the example above, a traditional programme (in red on the left) goes through a series of defined steps and pre-programmed decision points at A, B and C to reach an outcome D (in green), whereas in the AI example (in blue on the right) the system calculates the best route to the outcome (the snake to point 2) based on the data it has been trained on (at point 1), not on explicitly defined and pre-programmed decision points. AI systems can also continuously ‘learn from experience’ and therefore the route taken to the outcome might be different each time the AI system is run (like a car driver taking different routes through a city based on experience of traffic conditions at different times of day).

Returning to a ‘digital doctor’ example, an ‘AI digital doctor’ could be trained on thousands (or millions!) of medical scans from sick and well patients to learn how to detect tumours, without following pre-defined rules which are otherwise very difficult to codify and write. Many human doctors may say that experience plays a significant role in clinical diagnosis, but an AI system can be trained on far more x-ray images than a doctor could ever experience, leading to AI systems having remarkable capabilities in areas such as breast cancer detection. For example a Swedish AI study in 2023 found that AI-supported breast cancer screening (the analysis of mammogram images) was as good as two radiologists working together 2. It also reduced their workload by 50% and led to 20% more cancers being detected early for treatment 3. This illustrates some of the incredible capabilities of AI and its benefit to society. But this also leads to an important concept in AI called ‘Explainable AI’. It is possible to verify the output of an AI system as correct (for example did a patient really have cancer or not), but it may not be possible to know exactly how the AI system got to a decision or outcome, as the AI has calculated the ‘interim steps’ (e.g. the blue snake in the diagram above) by itself, without human programming of the specific steps to be taken.

This is crucial to improve trust in artificial intelligence systems (i.e. to understand the magic inside the black box and to turn a ‘black box’ into a ‘glass box’). The ‘digital doctor’ example nicely illustrates why ‘explainable AI’ is so important (in this case for both the patient and the doctor) to understand why an AI system has made a decision and believes a patient has breast cancer before sending them for intrusive cancer treatment. When considering how an AI system is constructed, there are two primary methods for how an AI system ‘learns’ to perform a task, which are machine learning and deep learning. • Machine Learning : Machine Learning (ML) systems can learn from huge amounts of data and continuously improve their performance over time when provided with more and/or better quality training data. With this ‘knowledge’ gained from training data, machine learning powered AI systems can then make predictions (such as for weather forecasting), or recognise patterns in data (such as for image and speech recognition). • Deep Learning : Deep Learning (DL) is a more sophisticated subset of Machine Learning and uses complex processes inspired by the human brain called Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

Their pioneering research on deep learning in the 1990’s and early 2000’s led to major breakthroughs and their work is now used in a variety of AI powered applications, from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis. In 2018 the three researchers – nicknamed the ‘Godfathers of AI’ - were awarded the Turing Award , which is considered the highest honour in computer science (equivalent to a Nobel Prize) for their fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence. Media nicknamed “Godfathers of AI”4 The Turing Award is named after Alan Turing who was a brilliant British mathematician. He decoded the German Enigma machines during the Second World War (which were considered impossible to crack) by building one of the world’s first computers and was one of the main architects of modern computer science following the war. He is often considered one of the ‘founding fathers’ of modern computing. In 1950 Alan Turing published a groundbreaking paper called ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ which introduced the ‘Turing Test’ for artificial intelligence. This is still used today to test a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour and if it is indistinguishable from a human. At this time (early 2024) no computer has decidedly passed the Turing Test, but there have been some very convincing contenders. Modern, sophisticated, AI chatbots (such as Google Bard and Microsoft Copilot) can be very difficult to distinguish from a human.

Whether an AI system uses machine learning, or deep learning techniques to ‘learn’, there are different ways that AI algorithms can be ‘trained’, but the most common approaches are: • Comparing AI-generated outcomes or predictions to the correct answer: this is known as ‘Supervised Learning’ in which Al models are trained on data that has been correctly labelled (for example an AI animal recognition system could be trained on images of animals correctly labelled as cats or dogs). • Finding patterns in data: this is known as ‘Unsupervised Learning’ in which AI models are trained on data that has not been labelled. In this case the AI system learns by finding patterns in the data (for example edges, shapes, features, or colours in images of animals that are common to cats or dogs). • Trial & Error: this is known as ‘Reinforcement Learning’ in which AI models ‘learn by doing’. Each outcome of the AI training is either mathematically rewarded or punished, in a ‘trial and error’ feedback loop (for example an AI animal recognition system that identified a certain breed of dog as a cat would be ‘punished’, but ‘rewarded’ it if correctly identified it as a dog, even though it had not seen that breed before)",

As new algorithms are developed artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly capable. But AI requires two other important components to be successful – data and computing power. DATA : THE FUEL THAT DRIVES AI “Data is the new oil” is a phrase often associated with the digital age. Data is the fuel behind modern computing and AI algorithms, allowing them to learn, find relationships in data and make informed predictions and decisions. In today’s world, huge volumes of data are created as we go about our everyday lives. From text messages, emails, documents and social media posts, to photographs and videos on our smart phones. Humanity is generating massive amounts of information every day and even more data is created by millions of sensors around the world and in our homes, cars, cities, public transport infrastructure and factories.

Growth of social media: social media platforms generate many terabytes of text, video and audio data every day (1 terabyte = approximately 1500 CD’s) with billions of messages and posts made every minute. In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Head of WhatsApp (Will Catchcart) issued a tweet stating that approximately 100 billion messages were being exchanged every day on WhatsApp alone and it is estimated that videos shared on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube account for over half of all internet traffic.

Data provides the information required for AI models to learn and improve, and is the fuel for AI systems to undertake very complex tasks at scale. In particular ‘big data’ supports the rise of AI in the following ways : 1. Training Data: AI systems require substantial amounts of training data to learn patterns. This makes their predictions and decisions more accurate, which is especially important in areas such as self-driving cars where massive datasets of images and videos, from many different road scenarios, are captured and used to train AI algorithms, which can then perceive and navigate complex environments by themselves. 2. Feature Extraction: large and diverse datasets help AI algorithms to accurately identify and extract features from within data. This enables more accurate insights from AI systems, such as AI powered image recognition tools. 3. Model Performance: big data enhances the performance and robustness of AI models, allowing them to handle a wide range of situations and inputs. This is especially important in sectors such as healthcare, where AI systems can analyse extensive patient and medical data to assist in diagnosis, treatment and drug discovery. 4. Predictive Analytics: large datasets and AI can be used by businesses to forecast trends, customer behaviour and market shifts. This provides companies with actionable insights and helps with corporate decision making. 5. Personalisation: when AI systems can access large volumes of data on human behaviours, preferences, and interactions they can provide tailored suggestions and experiences for users.

A data warehouse is a repository that stores structured data, in a highly organised and optimised way. They can be thought of as very large, neatly organised, filing cabinets Data warehouses could store information such as booking data, hotel occupancy rates, flight schedules, pricing information, financial transactions, web traffic statistics or marketing campaign performance data. This structured way of storage can be easily searched and is very good at quickly finding specific pieces of information such as “how many people booked trips to the Caribbean last year?” or “what was the average cost of a hotel room in Paris this summer?” . Alternatively a data lake is a repository that can store all types of unstructured data, such as social media posts, images, videos, customer feedback surveys, or online reviews. A data lake can be thought of as a big, open room, into which all sorts of information can be thrown, in an unstructured and disorganised manner. This form of storage is good for collecting many different types of data and for keeping all the relevant information (within privacy limits), even when you’re not sure how, or when, it could be used in the future.

This data can be very large and very complex and needs to be processed very quickly, which requires a lot of computing power. For example, sophisticated AI chatbots (such as Google Bard, Microsoft Copilot) were trained on datasets that included hundreds of billions of words (for comparison the Bible contains fewer than one million words). To download this volume data on a typical home internet connection and then process it for AI training could take hundreds of years on a standard computer. This task therefore requires a special type of computing power. Let’s imagine you wanted to learn everything on the internet. In 2022 there were approximately 5.75 billion webpages online. If a person spent one minute studying every page, it would take a human approximately 11,000 years to ‘learn the internet’ (without any breaks!). The most advanced supercomputers in 2023, which contain advanced computing power, are now able to process this vast amount of data and use AI techniques (such as deep learning algorithms) to ‘learn’ all this information in only a few months! This remarkable advancement in modern computing power is enabling the current wave of AI innovations and powering many applications of AI that were simply not possible only a few years ago. The history of increasing computing power can be traced back to the 1960’s, when Gordon Moore (a co-founder of Intel) observed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit was doubling around every two years. This became known as ‘Moore’s Law’. This doubling led to exponential growth in the power of computer chips, which has enabled computers small enough, powerful enough and cheap enough to now sit",

This doubling led to exponential growth in the power of computer chips, which has enabled computers small enough, powerful enough and cheap enough to now sit on all of our desks and power the smartphones in our pockets. But to achieve AI breakthroughs required even more computing power. In the 1990’s a company called NVIDIA popularised the term ‘Graphics Processing Unit’ (GPU), which was typically an electronic circuit board that plugged into a computer to accelerate its power. This became a critical piece of technology for computer gamers (and later Hollywood), as it enabled very fast and realistic rendering of graphics and special effects. GPU chips led computer games to advance from pixilated images to realistic graphics in just a few years, to the point where they are now almost indistinguishable from real life. The images below show just how much computer graphics, powered by GPU chips, have improved in only the last 3 years. The rapid advance of GPU chips partly explains why now is a global moment for AI. As GPU technology evolved for computer games, a key innovation was their ability to process tasks in parallel (rather than sequentially as in normal computers) and it turns out the accelerated parallel processing required to create lifelike graphics in computer games and movies is ideal for powering AI applications and especially deep learning systems, such as sophisticated AI chatbots.

Computer chips are therefore a source of geo-political tension, especially between the U.S., China and the EU, who each have strategic ambitions for AI and have therefore announced plans, or legislation, to strengthen their local chip design and manufacturing capabilities.

As the global economy becomes increasingly dependent on digital technology, he argued that “the world needs more geographically balanced and resilient chip supply chains” 13. This is because many computer chip companies (including NVIDIA) are ‘fabless’ organisations, meaning they design and sell chips, but do not manufacture them. Their manufacturing is outsourced to a specialised ‘semiconductor foundry’, such as TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) which is by far the largest chip manufacturer in the world with approximately 55% market share. The second largest is Samsung in South Korea, with approximately 15% market share in 2023. This means around 70% of the world’s computer chips are manufactured by just two organisations. These power not only AI systems, but everything that requires a semiconductor chip, from cars to household appliances. As the world emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, this dependence was brought into sharp focus with very public halts to car production lines due to a global chip shortage. Quite simply without TSMC the global digital economy would grind to a halt. Raising awareness of this risk has led to further geo-political tensions surrounding the future of Taiwan, where TSMC is based. The very limited number of GPU chip designers and manufacturers around the world has therefore led several major technology companies to develop their own chips to power AI applications, including Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Tesla.

For many years this involved an AI solution either being considered as an Expert System, or as Predictive AI, but now also includes a relatively new field of artificial intelligence functionality called Generative AI. An AI Expert System is a smart computer program that uses AI to simulate the expertise of humans in a specific area, such as for travel planning, medical diagnosis or financial advice. Expert systems contain a knowledge base of rules and facts about a specific domain, which are combined with AI (in a system called an ‘inference engine’) to reason through problems and provide advice, or recommendations. For example a travel AI expert system could help travellers to plan and book their trips. This would start with the collection of a large amount of data relating to travel, such as information on destinations, hotels, airlines, restaurants, excursions and travel regulations, which would be fed into a knowledge base. Travellers could interact with the AI expert system through a friendly user interface (such as a website, smartphone app, or chatbot) in a natural, conversational way to communicate their travel dates, budget and interests, and the AI ‘brain’ could provide personalised recommendations and itineraries. To complete the process, AI expert systems can also be integrated with booking platforms to enable travellers to make reservations directly through the system. AI expert systems therefore capture human knowledge and combine it with AI to provide expert level advice and conclusions.

They do this by analysing large amounts of data to identify patterns, trends and relationships that can help to anticipate the future. A common form of predictive AI is weather forecasting, which analyses historical weather data and current conditions to predict the likely future weather. An example of how predictive AI can used in travel is for flight delay predictions. An airline may use a predictive AI system to analyse a variety of historical and real time data including weather conditions, aircraft maintenance issues, airport congestion and other factors that could impact delays such as air traffic control data.

Predictive AI therefore allows airlines to get ahead of potential disruptions to their operations. Predictive AI can also be combined with other forms of data analytics to create more comprehensive and powerful approaches to solving complex problems and gaining valuable business insights. Examples of other data analytical techniques that can be combined with predictive AI include: • Descriptive Analytics: this summarises the past using historical data and helps to answer questions such as WHAT, WHERE and WHEN something happened by using methods such as dashboards, reports and other visual imagery to see and analyse patterns. For example this could involve analysing flight delay reports and displaying key information on a dashboard. • Diagnostic Analytics: this aims to understand WHY something happened by investigating its root cause. For example by analysing weather data and aircraft maintenance logs it may be possible to diagnose why flight delays occurred. These important insights from diagnostic analytics can also improve the accuracy of predictive AI models. For example, by understanding the reasons for past flight delays, it can help to better predict potential future delays. • Prescriptive Analytics: this suggests HOW to act in the future based on the data insights. By combining predictive AI forecasts with prescriptive recommendations it enables better planning and responses to potential future events.

It has not simply copy-and-pasted these responses from the WTTC website, as these exact paragraphs, descriptions and tables do not exist in this format on the WTTC website. However in the last example, where the AI chatbot was asked to provide the months that the reports were published, it has provided incorrect information. This is known as a ‘hallucination’ and is a feature of all AI chatbots today. Sometimes they produce answers, information and statistics that look accurate and sound convincing, but are in fact incorrect. This is due to the complex way that large language models produce their output. Some common reasons for hallucinations are illustrated below. Reasons for Generative AI Hallucinations In the AI chatbot example above, the table is also incomplete as it has missed other reports published by WTTC in 2022, including a report on ‘Critical Factors to Attract Hotel Investment’ (published in June 2022) and a joint report with Harvard University on the ‘Circular Economy in Travel & Tourism’ (published in May 2022).

The UK government therefore hosted the world’s first AI Safety Summit in November 2023. Many countries are currently leveraging their existing legal and policy frameworks to manage the risks of AI, whilst in Europe the EU is advancing a continent wide ‘AI Act’ to responsibly seize the opportunities presented by AI. Many other multinational groups including several UN bodies, the G7 and private sector companies are also developing responsible AI guidelines. These are discussed further in the ‘AI Risks & Governance’ report from WTTC. In September 2023, an OECD report prepared for the 2023 Japanese G7 Presidency identified seven common challenges posed by generative AI that require international alignment and collaboration 23. The report noted that international policy frameworks for generative AI should be inclusive and feature input from a diverse range of stakeholders, not just ‘AI experts’ and include the perspectives of governments from both developed and developing countries, private companies, civil society and interested sectors of the economy. This includes international Travel & Tourism.

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) – the UN agency responsible for advancing digital technology – estimates that 34% of the world has never been connected to the internet (in 2022), representing 2.6 billion people 25. Therefore a third of the world’s population does not have access to AI. The ITU considers that ‘universal and meaningful digital connectivity’ 26 (defined as a ‘the possibility for everyone to enjoy a safe, productive and affordable online experience’) should be a global priority. The ITU states that the AI revolution should benefit everyone in the world and should not worsen the international digital divide. ITU data shows that the global youth are the driving force behind connectivity, with 75% of all 15-24 year olds in the world now online, compared to 65% amongst the rest of the population. Sadly the affordability of entry level fixed and mobile internet services is leaving populations in the least developed countries (LDCs) behind. ITU data from 2022 finds that in a typical low income economy, the cheapest mobile broadband costs 9% of a person’s income (over 6x the global average) and in those least developed countries 64% of the population is not connected to the internet (almost double the global average of 34% who are not online). To begin to address this issue, the UK and Canada announced an ‘AI for Development’ vision at the 2023 UN General Assembly (UNGA) 27, which aims to boost local AI skills, innovation and computing power in the world’s poorest nations, with an initial focus on Africa.

In 2023, international HR and recruitment company Randstad surveyed 7,000 employees in companies of all sizes, across 34 countries and found that only 13% of workers had been offered any form of AI training in the last 12 months 29. This is despite a huge global surge in AI, with Randstad also observing a 20x increase in the number of new job postings across all industries requiring AI skills in 2023 30. Their research also found that AI training was the third most requested form of development requested by workers, after leadership and wellbeing training. A similar result was found in the GitLab 2023 global survey of software development companies 31. It’s showed that even when AI training was provided within organisations, there was a significant difference in the quality and availability of training across seniority levels. Those lower in organisations were most concerned about job losses from AI, yet were not provided the skills necessary to work with and alongside AI technology, with the report noting that “although this suggests that organisations are making a top-down attempt to make AI resources available to employees, those resources may not be adequate at lower levels” Commenting on the report, the training organisation Skillsoft said “investing in reskilling and upskilling is vital to ensure everyone can benefit from AI” . To ensure this, the firm argued “organisations must take a stronger stance on training employees to use AI strategically and responsibly within their existing roles” .

A 2023 global survey of corporate executives by the IBM Institute of Business Values also found that most business leaders estimate that implementing AI and automation within their company will require at least 40% of their workforce to re-skill over the next three years 32. But the thought of digitally retraining half, or more, of an entire workforce can seem like a daunting and expensive task. That is why organisations, such as Microsoft, Google and IBM offer basic AI training for free via their YouTube channel and website (such as online at Microsoft Learn 33, Grow with Google 34 or IBM Training 35), often in partnership with organisations such as LinkedIn Learning, Coursera and edX. In September 2023, IBM also announced a plan to help close the AI skills gap by training 2 million people in AI by the end of 2026, with a focus on underrepresented communities 36. To achieve this goal IBM is collaborating with universities and training providers around the world to deliver adult education and launching new generative AI coursework on topics such as ‘Prompt Writing’ and ‘Improving Customer Service with AI’ through IBM SkillsBuild 37. Many online creators are also making videos on how to use AI and there have been more than 1.7 billion views of videos related to AI tools on YouTube in 2023 alone 38.

Example Answer 1: Over the next decade, AI is set to reshape the travel and tourism industry in various ways. With its ability to process vast amounts of data, AI will offer personalised travel recommendations, optimise travel operations, and enhance customer service through virtual assistants and chatbots. AI will act as a virtual travel concierge, providing real- time assistance during travel and AI-powered smart recommendations will help travellers make better informed decisions. However, the industry will need to navigate ethical considerations and strike a balance between the benefits of AI and maintaining a human touch in the travel and tourism experience. Example Answer 2: Over the next decade, artificial intelligence will have a major impact on the travel and tourism industry. AI tools will be used to provide hyper-personalised recommendations for travellers, allowing companies to tailor suggestions based on individual interests and budgets. AI chatbots and virtual assistants will become ubiquitous, helping tourists research, book, and manage trips. AI could also help optimise routes and itineraries, reducing transit times and creating more seamless journeys. Behind the scenes, AI will enable businesses to forecast demand more accurately, adjust pricing dynamically, and target marketing campaigns more precisely.

The below table summarises some key terms that would be helpful for every business leader to have a basic appreciation of at a high level. By understanding the basics of these concepts it will help to ground AI systems into practical situations that business leaders can relate to. Description Examples Narrow AINarrow AI (sometimes called weak AI) is a type of AI that is designed to only perform a specific task, or set of tasks.Examples of narrow AI include smart speaker voice assistants, computers capable of playing chess, or AI medical systems able to analyse images and detect cancer. These are narrow AI examples as they are only able to perform tasks that they have been specifically trained for – for example the AI medical imager is not able to also play chess. Business leaders could use narrow AI systems to automate tasks such as repetitive data entry, transcribing speech, or recommending products. General AIGeneral AI (sometimes called strong AI, of Artificial General Intelligence [AGI]) is a type of AI that is designed to perform any intellectual task that an ‘average’ human can do. Whilst sophisticated AI chatbots have been trained with very large non-topic specific datasets and are therefore able to do many impressive things and recognised by Microsoft researchers as able to exhibit early “sparks of artificial general intelligence” 39, true general AI, which can rival human intelligence in all aspects, remains a theoretical concept and has not yet been achieved. True general AI would also require the AI to be able to interact with the real world (to perform tasks humans can do) and therefore require embodiment –",

This could involve embedding AI into robots for interaction with the physical world, or AI in virtual avatars that can perceive and act upon a virtual environment (such as in the ‘metaverse’).An example of AI embodiment could be a hotel that implements an AI powered check in, or concierge robot, to assist guests in the lobby and interact with them in a safe and productive way. Whilst embodiment is required for true General AI to be realised, this hotel example is a form of Narrow AI with embodiment, as the robot is only able to perform specific tasks – it cannot do all tasks that a human could do, such as carry guests’ luggage to their room. Machine LearningMachine learning is a type of AI that involves training algorithms with large amounts of data, so that a computer is capable of making predictions, or decisions.An email spam filter can be an example of an AI system using machine learning. By training an AI algorithm on a dataset of known spam and non-spam emails, it can learn to distinguish between the two and is then able to automatically detect and filter out new spam messages, even though it has never seen them before. Deep LearningDeep learning is a type of advanced machine learning, which uses complex mathematical structures inspired by the human brain called ‘neural networks’. This enables a computer to identify complex patterns in data that would otherwise be too difficult to identify using traditional machine learning techniques.A bank could use deep learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions, by identifying patterns in complex financial data.

They are trained on massive datasets of text and computer code (hence the name Large - Language Models) to develop a deep understanding of language patterns, grammar and semantics, enabling them to generate new coherent, relevant and natural sounding textLarge Language Models (LLM’s) can perform a wide range of language related tasks, such as real time translation, writing documents, or answering questions in an informative way. The terms LLM and Generative AI are sometime used interchangeably, but are in fact different. An LLM is the underlying AI model that powers the language capabilities of a Generative AI system (such as an AI Chatbot). Foundational ModelsFoundational Models are a broader category of underlying AI architecture, which includes LLM’s, but also AI models trained with more than just text, such as large datasets of images, video or audio Foundational models are also referred to as ‘General Purpose AI’ in the EU 40.

They have wide uses and can be adapted (often referred to as ‘fine tuned’) with industry specific data and knowledge.

Prompting, Prompt Engineering and Prompt DesignPrompting is the process of providing instructions and examples to an AI system to guide it towards a desired output. Prompts could be in the form of text, images or other types of data, depending on the AI system and its capabilities. How a user prompts an AI system can significantly influence the outcome and results and therefore the related field of Prompt Engineering and Prompt Design is about experimenting and carefully crafting prompts to produce better, safer and more useful results. For example a marketing team may use prompt engineering to test multiple variations of prompts with an AI writing assistant, so that it generates the best social media captions that are accurate, in the desired style and friendly. Prompts could include information such as the: • Task: For example to tell a Generative AI system to write a poem • Context: For example the genre of the poem to write • Constraints: For example if there is a limit to the number of words A prompt could therefore be: “Write a limerick poem about AI in less than 20 words”",

Hallucinations can be misleading (or even dangerous) if not properly understood, but can also be useful for generating new creative content or exploring new ideas, such as for drug discovery. An example of hallucination may be an AI chatbot providing a false answer, rather than saying it doesn’t know the answer to a question, or an AI powered image recognition system that mistakenly classifies products, leading to incorrect order fulfilment. Hallucinations can sometimes be hard to spot. For example if an AI system output that 92 x 53 = 6784 (which is wrong), it would be hard to spot as a hallucination without manual verification.

It is therefore useful to have an awareness of these terms. In general more tokens and more parameters usually mean better, with bigger AI systems able to process, learn and generate better outputs, but bigger also means more computing resource, power, time and money is required to train and operate the AI system, so it can also be a trade-off decision.For example two AI chatbots developed in the UAE are called Falcon 7B and Falcon 40B which refers to their size of 7 billion parameters and 40 billion parameters. Models with smaller parameter counts are best suited to simpler tasks and tasks that require rapid responses, whereas models with very large parameter counts are best equipped to handle very complex and highly creative tasks. It is also useful for business leaders to understand the basic concept of tokens and ‘token limits’ when selecting, or interacting with AI chatbots. A rough ‘rule of thumb’ is that 1 token = 0.75 words (75%). Therefore 100 tokens are approximately equivalent to 75 words. If for example an AI chatbot states its combined input and output is limited to 2000 tokens, this means if a user question (e.g. prompt) is 100 tokens (~75 words), the maximum output could be 1900 tokens (~ 1425 words).

However ongoing AI research aims to maintain high quality outputs, with larger token limits. Alignment & GuardrailsAlignment and Guardrails are two very important concepts related to the ethical development and deployment of AI. Alignment refers to ensuring that AI systems objectives and behaviours match human values and goals. Guardrails can be guidelines, regulations, or formal constraints implemented to prevent AI systems from causing harm, or behaving inappropriately.As a business leader, it is crucial to establish alignment by defining the ethical boundaries for AI usage in your organisation (such as respecting user privacy). Implementing guardrails ensures that AI systems operate within those defined boundaries. For example when using an AI recruitment tool, an alignment mechanism could be used to ensure the AI system does not discriminate against certain groups of people and a guardrail might be used to prevent the AI system from accessing certain types of data, such as personal medical records.",
